üéØ PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS IMPLEMENTED
============================================================

Candle Mode Optimizations:
- Reduced analysis bars from 100 to 60 (40% faster)
- Enhanced MA crossover detection with momentum analysis
- Optimized RSI thresholds (40/60 vs 30/70) for more signals
- Market-adaptive configuration based on volatility

HFT Mode Optimizations:
- Ultra-sensitive RSI thresholds (48/52) for frequent signals
- Enhanced tick data extraction with multiple fallback methods
- Simplified MACD calculation for limited data scenarios
- Configurable analysis intervals (3-5 seconds)

üîß CONFIGURATION RECOMMENDATIONS
============================================================

For Production Use:
1. Enable auto_trading_enabled: true (currently disabled for safety)
2. Set appropriate lot sizes based on account size
3. Configure symbol-specific spread limits
4. Enable spread filtering for HFT mode in volatile markets
5. Set reasonable daily trade limits (10-20 for Candle, 50-100 for HFT)

For Testing:
1. Use 'always_signal' strategy for immediate signal generation
2. Enable diagnostic_mode for more frequent signals
3. Disable spread filtering for testing
4. Use small lot sizes (0.01-0.1)

‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN LIMITATIONS
============================================================

1. MACD Strategy: Requires more data points for optimal performance
   - Mitigation: Implemented simplified MACD for limited data
   - Status: Working but may generate fewer signals

2. Spread Filtering: May block legitimate trades in volatile markets
   - Mitigation: Configurable per symbol with disable option
   - Status: Working as designed

3. WebSocket Connection: Some clients may have connection issues
   - Mitigation: Robust reconnection logic implemented
   - Status: Working for most clients
